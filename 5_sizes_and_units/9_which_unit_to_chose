Which unit to chose? (opinionated)

#1.font-size(root element)
-% percent - change default font size, i.e 75%
- nothing - we may rather specify size on diffrent elements and not the root

#2 font-size in general:
-rem - probably best, easy to read
-em - mostly for children as it may get messy

#3 paddin/margin 
- rem

#4 border:
-px- border should not scale most of the time to i.e 50px

#5 width/height
-% - be aware of containing block and position property applied
-vw/ vh - if we have a reason to relate it to viewport

#6 top/bottom/left/right
-% as we usually need relation to our containing element
