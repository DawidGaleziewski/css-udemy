/* 
###1. Viewport - without it we cannot implement mobile design!
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 

#name="viewport" 
 - meta tag is targeting the viewport

#content="width=device-width
-contents width should be equal to the screen size of our device

#initial-scale=1.0
-zoom level we have, 1.0 is default value, 1.5 would zoom in.

# disable user scalling
user-scalable=no
- user cannot zoom in

#maximum-scale=4.0
-same as initial scale but restricts the ammount user can zoom in


#maximum-scale=1.0
-restricts the minimum scale for user

##################################
++ adjusts site to device viewport
++ if we look on pixels only we wont be able to display our website correclty

-- we cannot apply any design changes
-- limited impact 

###2. Media queries
++change the design depending on actual size
++ change more then size- ie color/ pictures etc
++ designed by programmer changes
