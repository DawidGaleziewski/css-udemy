/* !When use class and when to use ID */

/* ID: 
-only used once per page
-can be used for linking
-it is not good idea to use it only for styling, better use class

*/

/* CLASS:

    -re-usable
    -mark for styling purpose only (except js query)
    -strongly connected to CSS
    - using them is almost never wrong
    -most used selector type
